            Born the to Austrian customs officer Alois Hitler--who had been
             married twice before--and the former Klara Polzl, Adolf Hitler grew up in a small Austrian
             town in the late 19th century.At first he was really good at studies and was the leader in
              of his school group but later when they shifted and he got into a new school things did not
             go well , He was not performing well in school. He became a slow learner and did poorly in
             school. He was frequently beaten by his father. Things got worse when Adolf's
             older  brother, Alois Jr., ran away from home. His mother occasionally tried to
             shield him, but was ineffectual. Adolf's attempt to run away at 11 was unsuccessful.
             At the age of 14 he was freed when his father died .
             Hitler dropped out of high school at age 16 and went to Vienna, where he strove to become an 
             artist, but was refused twice by the Vienna Art Academy. Now he didn't have enough money to
              eat and was homeless . By this time Hitler had become an ardent
              German nationalist--although he was not German but Austrian--and when World War I broke out,
              he crossed into Germany and and joined a Bavarian regiment in the German army... <br/>
              ...</br>Hitler's mother died when he was 18 . Adolf Hitler, who had a close relationship with his
             mother, was devastated by her death and carried the grief for the rest of his life. He was
             assigned as a message runner but also saw combat. Temporarily blinded after a gas attack 
             in Flanders in 1918, he received the Iron Cross 2nd Class and was promoted from private 
             to corporal. In 1918, when the war ended, Hitler stayed in the army and was posted to the 
             Intelligence division. He was assigned to spy on several radical political parties that 
             were considered a threat to the German government...

       <h2 style="color: beige;" >  <font size="4">
        One such organization was the German Workers Party. Hitler was drawn by party founder Dietrich 
        Eckart, propagated doctrines of mysticism and anti-Semitism. Hitler soon 
        joined the party with the help of his military intelligence ties. He became party spokesman in 
        1919, renamed it the National Socalist German Workers Party (NSDAP/NAZI) and declared himself 
        its leader one year later. In 1920 Hitler's intelligence handler, Munich-based colonel 
        named Karl Haushofer, introduced the swastika insignia. In 1921 Haushofer founded the 
        paramilitary Storm Troopers ("Sturmabteiling", or SA), composed of German veterans of WWI and 
        undercover military intelligence officers. </br>
        ...</br>
        They helped Hitler to organize a coup attempt--the infamous "beer hall putsch"--against the 
        Bavarian government in Munich in 1923, but it failed. The "rebels" marched on Munich's city 
        hall, which was cordoned off by police. Hitler's men fired at the police and missed; the police
        fired back and didn't, resulting in several of Hitler's fellow Nazis being shot dead. Hitler 
        himself was arrested, convicted of treason and sent to prison .

        During his prison time he was coached by his advisers and dictated his book "Mein Kampf"
         ("My Struggle") to his deputy Rudolf Hess. He only served several months in prison before
          being released .  In his autobiography Mein Kampf, Hitler wrote that he had "honored my 
          father, but loved my mother" and said that his mother's death was a "dreadful blow."
          His book describes the process by which Hitler became antisemitic and outlines his 
          political ideology and future plans for Germany.<br>
          Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf of his hatred towards what he believed were the world's twin
           evils, namely communism and Judaism. He said his aim was to eradicate both from Germany 
           and moreover stressed his intention to unite all Germans in the process of destroying
            them .

                A few days before Christmas 1924, Adolf Hitler emerged a free man after nine months in prison, 
         having learned from his mistakes.Hitler had given
     considerable thought to the failed Nazi revolution (Beer Hall Putsch) of November 1923, and its 
     implications for the future.
     He now realized it had been premature to attempt to overthrow the democratic government by force
      without the support of the German Army and other established institutions. He was determined not
       to make that mistake again. Now, no matter how much his Nazi Party members wanted action taken
        against the young German democratic republic, it simply would not happen. He would not give in
         to them as he had done in November 1923, with disastrous, even laughable results .
         Hitler had a new idea on how to topple the government and take over Germany for himself 
         and the Nazis – play by the democratic rules and get elected.</br>

         "Instead of working to achieve power by an armed coup we shall have to hold our noses and enter
          the Reichstag against the Catholic and Marxist deputies. If outvoting them takes longer than 
          outshooting them, at least the results will be guaranteed by their own Constitution! Any 
          lawful process is slow. But sooner or later we shall have a majority – and after that Germany,"
          hitler stated while in prison. </font> </h2>

            The Nazi Party would be organized like a government itself, so that when power was achieved
             and democracy was legitimately ended, this 'government in waiting' could slip right into 
             place.</br>
              But before any of this could be started, Hitler had some problems to overcome. After
              the Beer Hall Putsch, the government of the German state of Bavaria banned the Nazi Party
               and its newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter (Peoples' Observer). Also, the Nazi Party
                was now badly disorganized with much infighting among its leaders.
            
            Early in 1925, Hitler visited the Prime Minister of Bavaria and managed to convince him to 
            lift the ban, on the promise of good behavior, and after promising that the Nazis would work 
            with the rules of the democratic constitution.
        By 1925 the Nazi party was in much better straits both organizationally and financially, as it had 
         secured the backing of a large group of wealthy conservative German industrialists, who funneled 
        huge amounts of money into the organization...</br>
         Hitler was provided with a personal bodyguard unit named
        the "Schutzstaffel", better known as the SS. The Nazis began to gain considerable support in 
       Germany through their network of army and WWI veterans, and Hitler ran for President in 1931...

        Defeated by the incumbent Paul von Hindenburg, Hitler next attempted to become Chancellor 
        Hitler was appointed Chancellor in January 1933. One month later, a mysterious fire--which
         the Nazis claimed had been started by "terrorists" but was later discovered to have been 
         set by the Nazis themselves--destroyed the Reichstag (the building housing the German parliament)
         . Then Hitler's machine began to issue a series of emergency decrees that gave the office of
          Chancellor more and more power of Germany.n March of 1933 Hitler persuaded the German
           parliament to pass the Enabling Act, which made the Chancellor dictator of Germany and 
           gave him more power than the President. Two months later Hitler began "cleaning house";
            he abolished trade unions and ordered mass arrests of members of rival political groups.</br>

        By the end of 1933 the Nazi Party was the only one allowed in Germany. In June of 1934 Hitler 
    turned on his own and ordered the purge of the now radical SA--that he now saw as a potential threat
     to his power , was assasinated.Soon President Hindenburg died, and Hitler merged the office of 
     President with the office of Chancellor. In 1935 the anti-Jewish Nuremburg laws were passed on 
     Hitler's authorization. A year later, with Germany now under his total control, he sent troops 
     into the Rhineland, which was a violation of the World War I Treaty of Versailles.
     In 1938 he forced the union of Austria with Germany and also took the Sudetenland on the 
     pretext of "protecting" the German population from the Czechs.</br></font></h2>
     <h2 style="color: beige;" > <font size="4">
     In March 1939 Hitler overran the rest of Czechoslovakia. On 23 August 1939 Hitler and Joseph 
     Stalin made a non-aggression treaty. In September of 1939 Hitler and Stalin invaded Poland. 
    France and the British Commonwealth and Empire declared war on Germany. In 1940 Germany occupied
     Denmark, Norway and the Low Countries, and launched a major offensive against France. Paris fell
     and France surrendered, after which Hitler considered invading the UK. However, after the German 
    Air Force was defeated in the Battle of Britain, the invasion was canceled. The British had begun 
    bombing German cities in May 1940, and four months later Hitler retaliated by ordering the Blitz.
     In 1941 German troops assisted Italy, which under dictator Benito Mussolini was a German ally, in 
     its takeover of Yugoslavia and Greece. Meanwhile, in Germany and the occupied countries, a program
      of mass extermination of Jews had begun.</br>
      <img src="ww2.jpg" width="350" lenght="150" align="right" hspace="20">
      On June 22, 1941, German forces invaded the Soviet Union. In addition to ore than 4,000,000 German
       troops, there were additional forces from German allies Romania, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, 
       Croatia, Spain and Finland, among others. Hitler used multinational forces in order to save
        Germans for the future colonization of the Russian lands.</br> Following the detailed Nazi plan, 
        code-named "Barbarossa," Hitler was utilizing resources of entire Europe under Nazi control to 
        feed the invasion of Russia. Three groups of Nazi armies invaded Russia: Army Group North 
        besieged Leningrad for 900 days, Army Group Center reached Moscow and Army Group South occupied
         Ukraine, reached Caucasus and Stalingrad. After a series of initial successes, however, 
         the German Armies were stopped at Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad. Leningrad was besieged 
         by the Nazis for 900 days until the city of 4,000,000 virtually starved itself to death. Only
          in January of 1944 was Marshal Georgi Zhukov able to finally defeat the German forces and 
          liberate the city, finally lifting the siege after a cost of some 2,000,000 lives.</br>
          <img src="duck.jpg" width="350" lenght="150" align="left" hspace="20">
          In 1943 several major battles occurred at Kursk (which became the largest tank battle in 
          history), Kharkov and Stalingrad, all of which the Germans lost. The battle for Stalingrad was
           one of the largest in the history of mankind. At Stalingrad alone the Germans lost 360,000
           troops, in addition to the losses suffered by Italian, Hungarian, Romanian, Czech, Croatian 
           and other forces, but the Russians lost over one million men. By 1944--the same year the 
           
           Western allies invaded occupied Europe--Germany was retreating on both fronts and its 
           forces in Africa had been completely defeated, resulting in the deaths and/or surrender 
           of several hundred thousand troops. Total human losses during the six years of war were 
           estimated at 60,000,000, of which 27,000,000 were Russians, Ukrainians, Jews and other people 
           in Soviet territory. Germany lost over 11,000,000 soldiers and civilians. Poland and 
           Yugoslavia lost over 3,000,000 people each. Italy and France lost over 1,000,000 each. 
        Most nations of Central and Eastern Europe suffered severe--and in some cases total--economic
         destruction.</br>

          Hitler's ability to act as a figurehead of the Nazi machine was long gone by late 1944. 
        Many of his closest advisers and handlers had already fled to other countries, been imprisoned
         and/or executed by the SS for offenses both real--several assassination attempts on Hitler--
         and imagined, or had otherwise absented themselves from Hitler's inner circle. For many years
          Hitler was kept on drugs by his medical personnel.</br>
         In 1944 a group of German army officers 
          and civilians pulled off an almost successful assassination attempt on Hitler, but he survived.
           Hitler, by the beginning of 1945, was a frail, shaken man who had almost totally lost touch 
           with reality.
           <img src="poland.jpg" width="350" lenght="150" align="right" hspace="20">  The Russians reached Berlin in April of that year and began a punishing assault
            on the city. As their forces approached the bunker where Hitler and the last vestiges of his
            government were holed up, Hitler killed himself.
            
             Just a day earlier he had married his 
            longtime mistress Eva Braun. Hitler's corpse was taken to Moscow and later shown to 
            Allied Army Commanders and diplomats. Joseph Stalin showed Hitler's personal items to 
            Winston Churchill and Harry S. Truman at the Potsdam Conference after the victory. 
            Hitler's personal gun was donated to the museum of the West Point Military Academy
             in New York. Some of his personal items are now part of the permanent collection at
              the National History Museum in Moscow, Russia.
